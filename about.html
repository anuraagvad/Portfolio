            <p>I'm Anuraag and I'm based off Bangalore and Chennai, I've been brought up for the most part in Dubai and Bangalore and attend college at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai currently where I'm pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, graduating in 2024.</p>

            <p class="mid midsmall">I've been really enjoying experimenting with computer science and collaborating with people from other specializations for projects<br>
            I'm yet to figure out the path I want to pursue but currently I'm a front-end developer and know my way around Data Analytics using RStudio and Python(Pandas and NumPy)
        <br><br>For "timepass" I dabble into illustrating and communication design where I've worked upon branding and design for a few small businesses and enjoy creating digital assets like quirky icons, detailed line work or even just working on the color palette for the project. An example of that would be this website itself and the illustrations on it for the little icons here and there along with my Behance where I occasionally convert my terrible puns to art
    <br><br>That box on top is definitely not a metaphor.<br>Have a great day ahead!</p>
